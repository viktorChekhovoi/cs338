===== DAYTIME =====

1. 1 192.168.109.128 129.6.15.30 TCP [SYN]
   2 129.6.15.30 192.168.109.128 TCP [SYN, ACK]
   3 129.168.109.128 129.6.15.30 TCP [ACK]

2. The client uses port 13. It needs a port because the Netcat process sends some data to an external server, so it uses a port to send and receive data.

3. 4 129.6.15.30 192.168.109.128 DAYTIME "DAYTIME response"

4. The frame contains information on the order of the frame in the, the time since the process started, the length of the packet, and other information: reserved flags (like SYN or FIN), sequence number, window size, acknowledgement number, and the maximum segment size - the maximum size of the response.

5. [SYN] signals the start of communications between a client and a server.

6. [ACK] is used to acknowledge that a packet was successfully received.

7. [FIN] is used to stop the communication between a client and a server. 

8. The client initiated the termination. I determined that by looking at the source IP in the request containing [FIN]. The IP address was equal to my IP, so I knew it was the client.

===== HTTP =====

1. I found two packets that would open a TCP connection. For both, the source was my computer, the destination was the server, and they had only the [SYN] flag

2. Yes, I found it by looking at the protocols used by some of the first requests. The frame is 

        4 192.168.109.128 45.79.89.123 HTTP GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 

        I determined that it's the required frame by looking at its summary in WireShark, which said that this packet requested the URI /index.html

3. Yes, I found it by looking at the info field. The frame is 
        39 45.79.89.123 192.168.109.128 HTTP HTTP/1.1 200 OK (JPEG JFIF image)

        I think it's the correct frame becase it retrieved a JPEG image, which would be the image of Jeff's head.
