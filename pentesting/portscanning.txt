1. Passive information gathering

1) I picked basilspizza.net 
2) 199.34.228.156
3) 3/15/2026
4) Running 'whois basilspizza.net' gives me the following information:
    Registrant Name: Alexandra and Theologia Pitsavas
    Registrant Street: 301 S. Water St
    Registrant City: Northfield
    Registrant State/Province: MN
    Registrant Postal Code: 55057
    Registrant Country: US
    Registrant Phone: +1.5072138044

    Just from whois, I know the owners' name, address, and phone number

2. Host detection

1) 192.168.109.2, 192.168.109.128, 192.168.109.130
2) Other virtual machines open on my computer (192.168.109.130 is Metasploitable, 192.168.109.128 is Kali, 192.168.109.2 is likely some VMware service)
3) Source (my laptop) sends a TCP [SYN] packet to ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) of the destination. In all cases, it gets [SYN, ACK] from port 80, indicating it's open, but [RST, ACK] from port 443, meaning it's closed.
   The source then sends back another [ACK] to port 80, then terminates the connection with [RST, ACK]. 

4) IP addresses found: 137.22.4.5, 137.22.4.17, 137.22.4.131
   These addresses belong to devices on the Eduroam network. 
   Same procedure: the source (my laptop) sends a TCP [SYN] packet to ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) of the destination. In all cases, it gets [SYN, ACK] from port 80, indicating it's open, but [RST, ACK] from port 443, meaning it's closed.
   The source then sends back another [ACK] to port 80, then terminates the connection with [RST, ACK]. 
   
3. Port scanning

1) 21/ftp, 22/ssh, 23/telnet, 25/smtp, 53/domain, 80/http, 111/rpcbind, 139/netbios-ssn, 445/netbios-ssn, 512/exec, 513/login, 514/tcpwrapped, 1099/java-rmi, 1524/bindshell, 2049/nfs, 2121/ftp, 3306/mysql, 5432/postgresql, 5900/vnc, 6000/X11, 6667/irc, 8009/ajp13, 8180/http.
2) mysql and postgresql
3) 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3; the RSA SSH host key is used for authenticating users: the server stores the public key, and anyone with the corresponding private key can connect.
4) The service running on port 8009, ajp13, stands for Apache JServ Protocol 1.3. This is a binary protocol that establishes communication between the web server and the application server that controls the data that goes to the web server. Since it's a binary protocol, the data transmitted is not limited to only human-readable ASCII characters. As a result, it takes up less space but can only be read by a machine.
