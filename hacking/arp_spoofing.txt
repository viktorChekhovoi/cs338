i. It would send the query to 00:50:56:ea:1e:d2, which is the MAC address corresponding to the default gateway. Since cs338.jeffondich.com isn't on the local network, Metasploitable needs to send the packet through the gateway.
j. The Metasploitable command prints the html of the webpage. Wireshark captured the following packets:

    Metasploitable and the web server go through a TCP handshake (1-3), Metasploitable sends a GET request (4) and the server sends back the response (5-7). After that, the connection is terminated (8-11)

   Every MAC address was replaced with Kali's MAC address!

m. I think Metasploitable will should a packet to the Kali MAC address. Normally, the packet would go to the gateway, but due to the ARP poisoning, Metasploitable thinks it has the gateway's MAC address cached and so it will send a packet there. However, it will go through Kali, which will let the system eavesdrop.
n. Done!
o. On Metasploitable, the command still returns the HTML of the webpage. On Kali, I can see some packets I couldn't see before, like "TCP Retransmission" and "TCP Out-Of-Order" packets, as well as one "Keep-Alive" packet.
p. During an ARP poisoning attack, Kali sends continuous ARP replies to the target address that claim that every other address on the network has the MAC address of the attacker. Since the ARP protocol was designed in 1982, it may not have accounted for PITM attacks. 
As a result, the target of the attack will accept any reply, according to the protocol. 
q. In general, a device can only have 1 IP address and 1 MAC address, establishing a 1:1 correspondence between MAC and IP. Based on this, an ARP spoofing detector can periodically monitor the computer's ARP cache and take action/notify the user when it detects multiple IPs with the same MAC address.
However, in some cases, it's possible for one MAC address to correspond to several IPs (https://www.quora.com/Can-one-MAC-address-have-multiple-IP-addresses, not the most reliable source but it has explanations). This kind of spoofing detection would treat these as evidence of an attack, resulting in a false positive.
