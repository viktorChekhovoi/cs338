Part 1

Number of hashes computed: 267733
Passwords cracked: 2805
Time per hash computed: [seconds per hash]
Time per password cracked: [seconds per password]
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 0.01048

Part 2

Passwords cracked: [number cracked]
Time per hash computed: [seconds per hash]
Time per password cracked: [seconds per password]
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: [passwords per hash]

Part 3
Total time: [user time from a "time" command]
Number of hashes computed: [count of the # of hashes computed] 
Passwords cracked: [number cracked]
Time per hash computed: [seconds per hash]
Time per password cracked: [seconds per password]
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: [passwords per hash]

Analysis:
- Did your time per hash computed change between phases? By what factor? Why?
- Did your time per password crack change between phases? By what factor? Why?
- Suppose you wanted to precompute all the hashes for each possible password
so you could just look up the password in a table indexed by the hash. How much
memory would be required for each phase?
- Give 3-4 reasons we should store password hashes and not the passwords themselves.
Think in terms of threats, who the attackers might be, etc.
